# ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this part you will learn how to declare a python class. Remember 
# a class describes a real-world entity and contains attributes and 
# methods. Your mission in this lab exercise is to make a class called 
# User. This User class will hold the user info commonly associated 
# with an online login.
#
# STEPS:
# 
# 1. Declare a class called User.
# 
# 2. Within User class, create attributes for the username, first name 
#    and last name.
# 
# 3. Within User class, make a method called describe_user() that prints 
#    a summary of the user's information.
#
# 4. Within User class, make another method called greet_user() that 
#    prints a personalized greeting to the user.
#
# 5. Create three instances representing different users, and call both 
#    methods for each user.

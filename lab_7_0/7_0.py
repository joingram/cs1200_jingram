# YOUR ASSIGNMENT
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Imagine you are writing software for Cafe 1200, a casual dining spot 
# with wait times. 
#
# As groups of people come in, you want to get their last name and 
# number of people in their party. Then, based on their answer, you 
# will provide an estimated wait time until their table is ready.
#
# The average wait times at Cafe 1200 are as follows:
# - A party size of 1 - 2 can be seated immediately
# - A party size of 3 - 4 can be seated in approximately 10-12 minutes
# - A party size of 5 - 8 can be seated in approximately 20-25 minutes
# - A party size of 9 - 12 can be seated in approximately 30-40 minutes
# - A party size of greater than 12 will wait at least an hour
# - A party size of zero or less isn't funny; however your program
#   should be able to handle this edge case 
#
# Other instructions:
# - interact in a friendly manner with the customers
# - be exact and concise when writing prompts
# - After providing estimated wait time, you should ask user 
#   if they want to continue to next group of people or quit.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------


# Hint 1: start by greeting the people

# Hint 2: ask for name and then ask for size of party

# Hint 3: based on their answer, determine the wait time

# Hint 4: output the wait time

# Hint 5: ask user if they want to continue or quit.

Lab Exercise 5.0

IF STATEMENTS

In this lab we will learn how to run code based on some conditions.
Do all work in Geany IDE and follow instructions provided in this 
code file.

Learning Outcomes
=================
In this lab you will learn how to:
- write conditional statements
- declare if statements
- declare if-else statements
- declare if-elif-else statements 


Evaluation
==========
20 pts. - submitted filename 5_0.py
20 pts. - 5_0.py executes without error
30 pts. - Part 1 meets requirements
30 pts. - Part 2 meets requirements


Submission
==========
As before, submit your work on D2L or using git.
Earn 5 pts. extra credit by submitting using git by due date.

# PART 1
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this part we will practice how to use conditional operators.
# We will practice how to use many different operators so you will
# get a good understanding of how they work.
#
# In this part when you are asked to print a conditional statement,
# you should do something similar to this:
#
# print(your_conditional_statement_here)
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1a) You are provided following list of colors:

colors = ['blue', 'blue', 'green']


# Choose two colors from the list that are equal. Prove that they are 
# in fact equal by printing a conditional statement where you test
# their equality.





# Choose two colors that are not equal. Prove that they are not equal
# by printing a conditional statement where you test their inequality.

# 1b) You are provided following ages:

user1_age = 23
user2_age = 20
user3_age = 29
user4_age = 21
user5_age = 27

#  Is user1 older than user5? Print your conditional statement.




#  Is user3 younger than user2? Print your conditional statement.




#  Is user4 21 or older? Print your conditional statement.

# 1c) Declare a list variable called states which contains following 
#      values: Georgia, Texas, Oregon, Arizona, Maine



# Arizona is in the list of states. Print a conditonal statement where
# you prove that this is True.




# Ohio is not in the list. Print a conditional statement where you
# prove that this is True. 






#=======================================================================
# PART 2
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this part we will practice how to use if statements.
# We will practice several different cases so you can learn how they
# behave differently and learn how to choose the correct statement
# based on the requirements for your code.
#

# 2a) Declare a boolean varible is_student. You can set the value
# to by any boolean value.





# If user is a student, print "Hello student!". 
# Write this logical expression in python below. 






# TIP: You should change value of is_student and execute your code again
# to verify that your statement works correctly

# 2b) Declare string variable called country. Assing the value
# to be any country you want




# if country is 'United States' print 'USA'. Else print the
# variable value as-is.





# TIP: You should change value of country and execute your code again
# to verify that your statement works correctly

# 2c) Declare integer variable exam_grade. 




# Implement following logic in python:
#
# if exam grade is greater or equal to 90, 
# print 'Your grade is A! Good Job!'
# 
# else if exam grade is greater or equal to 80, 
# print 'Your grade is B'
#
# else if exam grade is greater or equal to 70,
# print 'Your grade is C'
# 
# else if exam grade is greater or equal to 60, 
# print 'Your grade is D'
#
# else print 'You failed'







# TIP: You should change value of exam_grade and execute your code again
# to verify that your statement works correctly

- Change letter case
- Declare integers
- Declare floats
- Perform basic math operations
- Identify and read python comments

Evaluation

# TASK 1

# Declare a variable
# Set the string's value to your first name
# Be sure to follow variable naming conventions
# Enter your code in the line below


# Declare another variable
# Set the string's value to your last name
# Be sure to follow variable naming conventions
# Enter your code in the line below


# Print your first and last name to the screen using concatenation
# Include one space between your first and last names


# Declare another variable to hold your full name
# Concatenate the values of your first and last name variables
# Save them as your full name in the line below below


# Just to be safe, convert your full name to all lower case below
# Save the value to be the new value of your full name variable


# Print out your full name again


# Print out your full name using the title() function


# Print your full name again, without title()
# This demonstrates you haven't changed the value


#***********************************************************************
print() # for whitespace - do not edit
#***********************************************************************
# TASK 2

# Declare an integer variable
# Give this variable the value of your favorite integer (not zero)


# Print your variable's value to the screen


# Declare another variable with a float value
# Give this variable the value of your favorite float (not zero)


# Print this variable's value to the screen


# Divide your integer by your float (int / float)
# Print this calculation to the screen


# Now divide your float by your integer (float / int)
# Print this calculation to the screen as well

# That's it for today!
